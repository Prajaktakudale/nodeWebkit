			<h1>Meet the new Renault Duster</h1>
	</div>
		<div id = "info">	
			<p>Unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show, the new Duster will make it to India soon. The new Duster gets a major facelift up front, which includes a new stylish grille, a new air intake and headlamps with daytime running lights. Although the side profile looks unchanged, 16-inch Dark Metal alloy wheels look good. The rear gets new tail-lamps and lots of chrome. 
			Minor changes to interiors such as steering mounted controls, infotainment system, reshuffled buttons etc. are evident in the photographs. Although mechanically it remains the same, rumour has it that the 1.6-litre petrol engine will be replaced by a 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol engine. Take a look at the photographs for more details. </p>
